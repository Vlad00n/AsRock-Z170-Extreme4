# AsRock-Z170-Extreme4
Modded BIOS with Coffee Lake support, 4G Encoding Enabled, ReBar Enabled, CSM disabled.
How to use it :
This modded .rom file allows you to flash your BIOS with Coffee Lake support, 4G Encoding enabled, ReBar enabled, CSM disabled.
In my case I've used in In BIOS feature "Instant Flash" to flash the modded BIOS. It needs just to rename the file to : Z17EX47.51 so Instant Flash can "see" it.
